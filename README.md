# python-challenge

This is a repo with 2 seperate projects. These projects aim find the desired outcome of an election and to make conclusions about monthly end statements of a bank. 

This is done entirely in Python 3.8 on VSC IDE with only an import module and a csv reader module.

In these scrips i demonstrate my ability to read and write to a CSV file, use for loops, lists, dictionaries, conditional statements and other various functionalities of Python 3.8.

I essential iterated through a file in search of distinct values to complie and calculate so i could make meaningful determinations out of that dataset. 

I am a novice dev and my code may be hard to read and unneccessarliy heavy but i feel like my use of comments and spacing makes it intelligible and self-explanatory for the most part.

This project has no minimum hardware requirments but the PyPoll file is large so beware, it does not fit in an excel.
